## About The game *Simon* 
*Simon* was named after the children's game *Simon Says*. It was ceated by Ralph Baer and relased in 1978. While attending a trade show in 1976, Baer was inspired by an Atari arcade game called *Touch Me* in which the user had to recreate the musical sequence the machine created. Although Baer believed that the execution of the game was terrible, he felt that the concept was worth exploring. 

In this game I recreated the same concept-the computer creates a color sequence for the user, the user then tries to recreate the random sequence. If the user recrerates the sequence a new color sequence is introduced, but if the user is unable to recreate the sequence the game is over.

## Getting Started
https://nanmardel.github.io/Project01/

### Instructions
1. To begin the game press "play"
2. After clicking play the computer will indicate a random color sequence by lighting up the squares.
3. The user then has one chance to recreate the random sequence by clicking the squares in the correct order.
4. If the user enters the correct color sequence, another color sequence will be introduced. 
5. If the user fails to recreate the sequence, the game is over.

## Next Steps
To further develop the game, I would like to include levels that get harder as the player progresses in the game as well as a timer to limit the amount of time the user has to enter the sequence provided by the computer.
